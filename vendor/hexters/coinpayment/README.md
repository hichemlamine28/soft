```
/**
* this is triger function for running Job proccess
*/
return \CoinPayment::getstatusbytxnid("CPDA4VUGSBHYLXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX");
/**

*/
```

## Get histories transaction Eloquent

\CoinPayment::gettransactions()->where('status', 0)->get();
```

# IPN Route

Except this path `/coinpayment/ipn` into csrf proccess in `App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken` 
```
. . .
/**
  * The URIs that should be excluded from CSRF verification.
  *
  * @var array
  */
protected $except = [
    '/coinpayment/ipn'
]; 
. . .
```
# Troubleshooting
## Cannot use object of type Illuminate\Http\JsonResponse as array
Visit the [**CoinPayment API Keys**](https://www.coinpayments.net/index.php?cmd=acct_api_keys) page, under *Actions*, click on the *Edit Permissions* button. Enter the IP address of your API endpoint (e.g. your website server) in the *Restrict to IP/IP Range* input. Leaving it empty, may cause this error to occur.
